# Lightning-Lookup
Salesforce Lightning Design System Lookup Component
Intended use - embedded in a VF page.

Borrows heavily from Tony Scott's Version (from which this is forked) here:
http://meltedwires.com/2015/10/31/salesforce-lightning-lookup-component-v2/

Changes include:
- a simpler initialization in the Visualforce page
- an init routine on load (to load any pre-existing data)
- A callback method that is called after selection or clearing of data in the lookup.
